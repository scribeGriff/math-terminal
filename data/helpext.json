  fft: "Description: Computes a fourier transform of an array of arbitrary length.  Uses a radix-2 FFT algorithm if the length is a power of 2 and a DFT otherwise.  Accepts an optional integer value for the power of the FFT.  Syntax: y = fft(x); or, optionally, y = fft(x, 16); where x is an array of real or complex values.  Returns a complex array.  Example: x = [0,1,2,3]; y = fft(x);  See also: re, im, ifft, fsps, conv",
  ifft: "Description: Computes an inverse fourier transform of an array of arbitrary length.  Uses a radix-2 FFT algorithm if the length is a power of 2 and a DFT otherwise.

  deconv: "Description: Performs a deconvolution (polynomial long division) of numerator and denominator.  Accepts position information.  Returns quotient, remainder and position information for each.  First coefficient assumed to be associated with highest power.
